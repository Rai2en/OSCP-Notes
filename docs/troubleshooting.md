# Troubleshooting without random retries

[Home](../README.md) · [Pivoting](pivoting.md)

Write the exact error, execution host, shell, identity, tool version and timestamp. Compare against one known-working operation. Change one variable per test.

| Symptom | Check first | Next controlled test |
|---|---|---|
| No scan response | Route, VPN interface, target state | A selected TCP connection; compare `ip route get` |
| DNS works on pivot only | Resolver and route to DNS server | Query that server explicitly; verify DC FQDN |
| Kerberos fails, NTLM works | DNS/SPN, clock, realm, ticket selection | Resolve intended service FQDN; inspect time and ticket cache |
| Login succeeds, shell denied | Protocol-specific authorization | Confirm groups and access on that exact service |
| Password rejected | Domain/local scope, quoting, account lockout | One known pair; stop repeated attempts while investigating |
| SMB hash fails | Hash type and username scope | Confirm this is an NT hash, not a captured challenge-response |
| No callback | Destination from the target's viewpoint | Harmless TCP connection or file download along that route |
| File downloaded but cannot run | Architecture, runtime, permissions, file integrity | Compare checksum; inspect file type and exact loader error |
| Web request differs from browser | Host header, cookies, redirects, encoding, CSRF | Replay an unchanged captured request first |
| SQL injection appears intermittent | Baseline, session expiry, network noise | Alternate control/test requests; keep other inputs fixed |
| BloodHound empty/incomplete | Collector edition, import and DNS errors | Confirm one known user, group and computer appear |
| Tool crashes with Python errors | Interpreter, dependencies, bytes/string assumptions | Isolated environment matching upstream requirements |
| Port already in use | Existing server/listener, wrong bind address | Inspect local listeners; choose a distinct port |
| Shell dies on disconnect | Session lifetime, process behavior, transport | Test persistence of a harmless process in the lab |
| Privilege exploit reports success | Identity, trigger, expected side effect | Check `id` or `whoami /all` in the resulting session |

## Minimum bug note

Do not “fix” every failure by disabling a firewall or antivirus. First determine which connection, permission or component failed; broad changes can hide the cause and make the result harder to reproduce.
